;  the first time we come here we must calculate things
If not(iRowsPerColumn)

	Calculate pPrintPos.$posmode as kPosLocal     ;; this sets $posvertpage and $poshorzpage

Calculate pPrintPos.$posmode as kPosLocal     ;; change our co-ordinate space to kPosLocal

Calculate pPrintPos.$top as iCurRow*iRowHeight
Calculate pPrintPos.$width as iColumnWidth
Calculate pPrintPos.$height as iRowHeight

Send to trace log {[pPrintPos.$posvertpage] / [pPrintPos.$left] / [pPrintPos.$top]}

		Calculate iCurColumn as 0     ;; reset columns
		Calculate iCurPage as iCurPage+1     ;; increment the page
